# Machine-Learning

In these machine learning projects, I work with MNIST dataset, MNIST fashion dataset, and the kaggle ConnectX evnironment.

I run these model on my GPU for faster results, if you do not have access to a GPU, I would use https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true
